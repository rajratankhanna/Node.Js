This repository offers a straightforward implementation of CRUD operations using Node.js as the backend, along with MongoDB as the NoSQL database. It is designed to help you manage users through basic functionalities: adding, deleting, and updating user information.

To get started with this project, you'll require the following technologies: Node.js for the server-side JavaScript runtime, Express.js for building web applications, MongoDB for the database, Mongoose for object modeling, EJS for templating, and CSS for styling your frontend. This combination provides a solid foundation for understanding how to create a functional web application.

The project is categorized as basic, making it an excellent starting point for anyone looking to improve their skills in Node.js and MongoDB. Itâ€™s a valuable addition to your resume and demonstrates practical experience in full-stack development.

To use this project locally, simply click the code button on the repository page and download the ZIP file. Once downloaded, extract the contents to your desired folder. Navigate to that folder and locate the package.json file. Before running the project, ensure that you have Node Package Manager (npm) installed on your machine to facilitate the download of necessary dependencies listed in the dependencies section of the package.json.

It's important to note that the node_modules folder is not included in the GitHub repository, as it typically contains many files that can be regenerated through npm, making it impractical for version control. Once the dependencies are installed, you'll be ready to run the project on your local environment, allowing you to explore and modify the code according to your needs.
